Password Manager
Description
This Password Manager is a Python-based application designed to securely store and manage passwords. It allows users to add, retrieve, and generate passwords for various services. The program uses encryption to ensure that all stored passwords are kept safe.

Features
Add Password: Securely add passwords for different services.
Get Password: Retrieve stored passwords.
Generate Password: Generate strong, random passwords.
Encryption: Passwords are encrypted using a Fernet key, which is encrypted and stored securely.
Password-Protected Key: The encryption key is encrypted with a user-provided password for added security.
How to Use
Run the Program: Use python3 password_manager.py to start the program.
Set a Password: If running for the first time, you'll be prompted to set a password for encrypting the key.
Choose an Action: Select from adding, retrieving, generating passwords, or quitting the program.
Interact as Prompted: Enter the required information based on your chosen action.
Installation
Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Dependencies include:

cryptography
bcrypt
Install these using pip:

Copy code
pip install cryptography bcrypt
Security
The program uses cryptography for password encryption and bcrypt for key derivation from the user-provided password. The encryption key is stored in a file named encryption.key, which is also encrypted using the user's password.

Limitations
The security of the passwords depends on the strength and confidentiality of the user-provided password.
Losing the encryption.key file or forgetting the password will render stored passwords irretrievable.
